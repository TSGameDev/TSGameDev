# Tyler Lazarus 
**`Digital Craftsman (Game Programmer)`**

I am a games programmer with a focus on gameplay programming, covering all elements of play from UI to Mechanics to AI. I currently have a focus on Unity and C# soon to expand to Unreal and GoDot learning GDScript and C++. My projects are made completely by me, unless stated, from design and conceptualisation to planning and development. I love to be able to take peoples ideas and craft them into a playable experience, I see it as an honour and I always look forward to learning more.  

If you would like to see my work, I recommend the following repos that best represent my current skill:
