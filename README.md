# Tyler Lazarus 
**`Digital Craftsman (Game Programmer)`**

I am a games programmer with a focus on gameplay programming, covering all elements of play from UI to Mechanics to AI. I currently have a focus on Unity and C#. I am currently learning about other sectors like software and web developmnet to expand into other sector and expand my skillsets. My projects are made completely by me, unless stated, from design and conceptualisation to planning and development. I love to be able to take peoples ideas and craft them into a playable experience, I see it as an honour and I always look forward to learning more.  

If you would like to see my work, I recommend the following repos that best represent my current skill:
